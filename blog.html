                    <strong>Local Storage</strong> allows 10MB of data to be stored. <br> And <strong>Session Storage</strong> allows 5MB of data to be stored.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    The stored data on <strong>Local Storage</strong> is not deleted when the browser is closed. <br>
                    The <strong>Session Storage</strong> data is stored only for the session and will be deleted when the browser is closed.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Local Storage</strong> is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. <br>
                    <strong>Session Storage</strong> Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Local Storage</strong> is especially useful for storing data that you want to persist even if the user closes the browser, such as preferences or settings. <br>
                    <strong>Session Storage</strong> is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Local Storage</strong> data is not sent with the request from the client to the server. <br>
                    <strong>Session Storage</strong> data is not sent with the request from the client to the server

                <p>
                    <strong>Local Storage</strong> data is stored on the browser and system. <br>
                    <strong>Session Storage</strong> data is stored on the browser only.

                <p>
                    In a programming environment, the <strong>global scope</strong> is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes. <br>

                    In client-side JavaScript, the <strong>global scope</strong> is generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed. <br> <br>

                    <strong>Block Scope:</strong> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    <strong>Event Loop:</strong> JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.

                    <strong>1) Accessing an uninitialized variable</strong> <br>
                    When you declare a variable and don’t initialize it to a value, the variable will have a value of undefined. <br> <br>

                    <strong>2) Accessing a non-existing property of an object</strong> <br>
                    If you access a non-existing property of an object, you’ll get undefined. <br> <br>

                    <strong>3) Function parameters</strong> <br>
                    Whwn you define a function with parameters but don't pass the arguments on invoking you will find undefined. <br> <br>

                    <strong>4) Functions return a value</strong> <br>
                    A function that doesn’t have a return statement implicitly returns undefined. <br> <br>

                    <strong>5) Accessing out-of-bounds array elements</strong> <br>
                    When you access an array element that is out-of-bounds, you’ll get the undefined value. <br> <br>
